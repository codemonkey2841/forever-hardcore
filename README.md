# Forever Hardcore

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.5+ that makes every respawn a new challenge!

## Description
**Forever Hardcore** randomizes your respawn location every time you die. Instead of respawning at your bed or world spawn, you'll appear at a safe, random spot anywhere within the world border. This makes survival more intense and exploration-focused.

## Features
- **Random Respawn:** Every time you die, you respawn at a random, safe surface location within the world border.
- **Surface Safety:** The mod ensures you won't spawn in the air, inside a block, or underground.
- **End Portal Return:** When returning from The End via the end portal, your spawn point is NOT randomized (you return to your previous spawn as normal).

## Installation
1. **Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)** for your Minecraft version (1.21.5+).
2. **Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)** and place it in your `mods` folder.
3. **Download this mod** (`forever-hardcore-x.x.x.jar`) and place it in your `mods` folder.
4. Launch Minecraft with the Fabric profile.

## Compatibility
- **Minecraft Version:** 1.21.5+
- **Mod Loader:** Fabric
- **Multiplayer:** Works on both singleplayer and multiplayer servers (all players will have random respawns).
- **Other Mods:** Should be compatible with most mods that do not override respawn logic.

## Usage
- Play Minecraft as usual.
- When you die, you will respawn at a random, safe location within the world border.
- If you return from The End via the end portal, you will respawn at your previous spawn point (not randomized).

## Support
If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on the mod's repository or contact the mod author.
